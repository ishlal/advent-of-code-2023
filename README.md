I'm not sure how seriously I'll take it this year, but I still aim to have fun with it

## Day 1:

I'm quite annoyed that this is a day 1 question. I feel like past contests' day 1 questions are usually just some sort of integer parsing; this felt more suited for a day 3 or 4

## Day 3:

This doesn't look like the type of question that I would enjooy implementing because there isn't too much critical thinking and problem solving involved and is more of an implementation problem. Decided to skip it. 

## Day 5:

Part 2 is not something I really want to implement because of the time it would take, but I still appreciate the problem!

## Day 6:
Recognized the equation right away for part b, but after discussion with @nlao, I learned that finding the zeros of the equation would have lessened the computation overhead instead of the brute force approach. However, the runtime is basically identical. It alsos seems like the input size HAD to be small, which is a bit unfortunate, making part 2 relatively trivial.
